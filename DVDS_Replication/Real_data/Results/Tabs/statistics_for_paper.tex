Using an AIPW estimator, we estimate an ATE of around $-5.5\%$ with a 95\% confidence interval of $[-7.9\%, -3.1\%]$
($\Lambda = 1.18$ for the \textit{ZSB} method, $\Lambda = 1.24$ for the \textit{DVDS} method)
odds of treatment by a factor of $\Lambda = 1.13$ could already reverse the original finding
Our lower confidence bound was $1.145$, meaning that it is highly unlikely the true ATE would be negative unless
