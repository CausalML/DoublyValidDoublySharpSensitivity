The file simplified_dvds.R implements the DVDS and ZSB methods, and is called by dvds_sim.R. }

To reproduce the figures in the paper:
1. First run dvds_sim.R.  This may take several hours, and will output data in the folder dvds_output
2. Then run dvds_plotting.R.  This is roughly instantaneous and will output plots in dvds_output

The file simplified_dvds.R implements the DVDS and ZSB methods.  It is called by dvds_sim.R.

The results reported in the paper were run on an Apple MacBook Pro running R version 4.2.1.
